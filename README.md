# Data Science Competitions
Each competition will have its own directory which will be turned into a blog post with [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).

I will be using [`fastai`](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) for these competitions.

## Environment Setup

I use `conda` to setup my environment on a Debian machine,

```python
conda install -c fastai pytorch fastai
```
